			Mark Frost    David Lynch










Revised First Draft
December 7, 1988







				ACT ONE

In DARKNESS the sound of a meadowlark's song.

FADE IN:

THE MEADOWLARK

The bright eye and beak of the bird, backlit by the first light of the rising sun.

EXT. INTERSTATE HIGHWAY "21" - DAWN

A long, straight, empty stretch of road leads up between two mountains, Whitetail
and Blue Pine, the Twin Peaks.

EXT. TWIN PEAKS TOWN SQUARE - DAWN

The picturesque center of the town of Twin Peaks; a small, neatly manicured park
with a pristine white gazebo its centerpiece. Fronting the park is the '30's-style
streamlined, concrete and glass City Hall. An early rising MAN walks two Irish 
setters through the square.

EXT. TWIN PEAKS DOWNTOWN - DAWN

In the shadow of a smaller mountain Sparkwood Hill, we see the slightly run down
business district, the core of Twin Peaks' old downtown.  A slow-moving freight 
train rumbles through the train station.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

A quiet, tree-lined street. White, clapboard houses with open porches. A
MILKMAN carries a crate of clinking milk bottles up the steps to one of the
houses. Behind him, a yellow schoolbus cruises slowly by.

EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN

Where Sparkwood Road meets Highway "21", a traffic light cycles from green to
yellow to red.

EXT. ED HURLEY'S GAS STATION - DAWN

On the highway. Not yet open for business.- No sign of life.

EXT. THE ROADHOUSE DANCE HALL - DAWN

A dog drifts through a parking lot, littered with last night's trash and beer bottles. 
The club's neon patron-snatcher flickers back and forth between two images of a 
couple doing the jitterbug.

EXT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - DAWN

Open for business Two Diesel rigs idle in the oil-stained gravel lot outside. A
couple of nighthawks sober up at the counter. A pretty country-western ballad 
plays on the jukebox inside.

EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - DAWN
An imposing granite structure overlooks the city from high on White Tail 
Mountain, one of the Twin Peaks. Automatic sprinklers kick on across the vast 
green-black lawns.

EXT. PACKARD SAWMILL - DAWN
A massive industrial structure on the south shore of Black Lake. Sawdust and 
steam shoot out of funnels and pipes. A distant tug shepherds a logjam towards 
the sawmill gates. A piercing steam whistle signals the end of the night shift.

EXT. THE PACKARD RESIDENCE - DAWN
Outside the huge log house, called Blue Pine Lodge, PETE MARTELL, a late-middle-
aged man, sets some fishing gear in the back of a pick-up, then goes inside.

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE KITCHEN - DAWN

Pete grabs a thermos of coffee and an apple, kisses his wife, KATHERINE 
PACKARD MARTELL, a sturdy, weathered woman, mid-fifties, fully dressed, at the 
table, newspaper and coffee in hand. She doesn't react to the kiss. Pete exits.

							CUT TO:

INT. BLUE PINE LODGE MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN.

GIOVANNA PASQUALINI PACKARD, a beautiful woman in her thirties, wearing a 
silk negligee, sits at a vanity table, combing her hair, lost in a dreamy state of 
mind. From outside, she hears Pete's pick-up drive off, turns to look out the 
bedroom's large picture window.

							CUT TO:
GIOVANNA'S POV

Looking down to the shores of Black Lake. A large logjam is visible near the 
sawmill dock.
							CUT TO:

EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN
Pete lifts his fishing gear from the pick-up end walks out onto the dock to drop a 
line.
							CUT TO:
 
PETE 
                    
He's about to cast out his line when his expression changes; he sees something
horrible. He sets his tackle and makes his way down a wooden stairway to a
landing at water level. He jumps across a gap of dark, oil-slicked water onto the
edge of a cabled log-raft. He steps cautiously across the shiny, barkless logs,
slowing as he approaches what it was that caught his eye ...
                    
							CUT TO:
A WOMAN'S BODY
                    
Face down, lying on the log raft, cut, bruised, broken and lifeless.
                    
PETE
                    
Shaking, he turns to go for help.
							CUT TO:
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE - DAY
                    
Highway "21", empty, running up between the twin peaks. A flying wedge of
motorcycle riders driving Harley's ride into view; seven young men, all between
seventeen and twenty-one, clean-cut, wearing black leather jackets. With MAIN 
TITLES and MUSIC over, we see the gang ride through various parts of the city.
                    
END TITLES
                    
FADE IN:
                    
EXT. SAWMILL DOCK - DAWN
                    
Pete, the middle-aged man, hurriedly punches in a number on a pay phone at the
end of the dock.
                    
				PETE
		Lucy, put Dan on the horn. 
							CUT TO:
                    
INT. SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN
                    
SHERIFF DAN STEADMAN, rugged, early forties, pours his first cup of coffee, as
the dispatcher, LUCY MORAN, turns to him from the switchboard.

				LUCY
		Sheriff, sounds like Pete Martell up at the Mill.
                    
Steadman punches line one and picks up the call.
                    
				STEADMAN
		Sheriff Steadman ... now hold on a second, Pete,
		where? ... you stay right there, I'm on my way.

							(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                  
He hangs up, grabs his hat and coat and heads for the door.
                  
				STEADMAN
			(to Lucy)
		You better get Dr. Hayward, tell him to meet me
		up at the Packard Mill, the dock right below the
		dam - and roust that Andy out of bed, tell him
		to get his butt up there now.
                  
				LUCY
		What is it?
                  
				STEADMAM
		We got a body up there. You don't say a word
		to anybody till you hear from me.
                  

Steadman exits.
							CUT TO:
EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAWN
                  
Steadman hops into his souped-up Diamond County Sheriffs Department cruiser,
fires up the big V-8 and rooster-tails it towards the highway, as his red and blue
toplights start spinning.
							CUT TO:
EXT. PACKARD MILL DOCK - MORNING

Steadman pulls up, lights still spinning, just as the Diamond County Coroner's
station wagon pulls up alongside. Steadman gets out and joins DR. WILLIAM
HAYWARD, the Medical Examiner, a tall, distinguished gray-haired man of sixty,
and they move towards the dock.
                  
				HAYWARD
		What've we got?
                  
				STEADMAN
		Let's go find out.
                  
They make their way down the wooden steps to the log raft. Waiting there are
Pete, his wife Katherine and Giovanna Packard, wearing a coat over a brocade
bathrobe, her beautiful hair and make-up in stark contrast to the harsh
surroundings.
                  
				PETE
		We haven't touched anything.

				STEADMAN
		Thanks, Pete.
			(tips his hat)
                                         
     
				STEADMAN (CONTINUED)
		Mrs. Packard ... Katherine...
     
				KATHERINE
		Our security guard didn't see anything.
     
Steadman nods, he and Hayward move forward to the body, on the edge of the
logs. Without touching anything, Hayward kneels beside the body and begins to
examine details.
     
				HAYWARD
		You want forensics first?
     
				STEADMAN
			(shakes his head)
		She's been in the water. Go ahead.
     
				HAYWARD
		Let's get some pictures.
     
Above them, on the dock, DEPUTY ANDY BRENNAN, young, intelligent but
awkward and shy, climbs down the stairs, carrying a forensic examination kit and a
camera.

				ANDY
		You need the kit, Sheriff? I've got the kit.
     
				STEADMAN
		Good. Bring that camera down here, Andy.
     
				ANDY
		Right.
			(as he passes the others)
		Ladies ... Pete.
     
				STEADMAN
		Doc wants some pictures before we turn her
		over.
     
				ANDY
			(staring at the body)
		Who is she?
     
				STEADMAN
		Andy, the camera. Then we'll turn her over and
		find out.

                   
				ANDY
		Sorry. Sure. Okay.
                   
Andy puts down the kit and shoots various angles of her back, as the others stand
out of the way. Andy kneels down to get a closer shot, pauses, slumps back down
to a sitting position and starts to weep.
                   
				HAYWARD
		Oh, Andy.
                   
				STEADMAN
		My God, Andy. Same thing as last year in Mr.
		Blodgett's barn.
                   
				ANDY
		Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
                   
				STEADMAN
		Is this gonna happen every damn time?
                   
				HAYWARD
		Give me the camera, Andy.
                   
Hayward takes the camera from him and takes some more pictures. Steadman
notices that a crowd of mill workers are gathering above on the dock.
                   
				STEADMAN
 			(giving him an out)
		Andy, get up on the dock and dear that crowd
		back.
                   
				ANDY
		Okay, Dan. Sorry.
                   
Drying his eyes, Andy walks back and starts up the ladder.
                   
Hayward takes a closeup of the girl's wrist, where he's found some small,
distinctive wounds. He puts the camera down on the forensic kit.

				HAYWARD
		Let's turn her over. Give me a hand here.
                   
Steadman and Hayward grasp her by the shoulders and knees end gently turn the
body over.
							CUT TO:
THE GIRL'S HEAD
                   
As the body turns and the face comes into view.
							CUT TO:


STEADMAN AND HAYWARD
                   
Seeing the face, they're both hit with a shock of recognition.
                   
				HAYWARD
		Oh Lord.  Laura ...
                   
				STEADMAN
		Laura Palmer.
                   
				HAYWARD
		Sweet Jesus ...
                   
				GIOVANNA
			(shocked)
		Laura? Is it Laura?
                   
Steadman looks back towards the others, where Giovanna has stepped forward
towards them. He catches her eye. Nods.
							CUT TO:
EXIT. LAURA PALMER'S HOUSE - MORNING
                   
A quiet, upper middle-class neighborhood. Manicured lawns. A PAPERBOY rides
by on a bike, flings a paper onto the front steps of the Palmer house.
                   
							CUT TO:
INT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
                   
SARAH PALMER, a thin, nervous chain-smoker, mid-forties, turns some bacon
over on the griddle, lights a cigarette and goes to the bottom of the stairs.
                   
				SARAH
		Laura, sweetheart, I'm not gonna tell you again!
			(silence; she waits)
		Laura!
			(no response; to herself)
		Oh for goodness sakes ...
                   
She starts up the stairs. 
							CUT TO:
                   
INT. PALMER HALLWAY
                   
Sarah opens the door to Laura's bedroom.
                   
				SARAH
			(annoyed)
		Laura, now means /I> -
                   
She stops short. Laura's bed has apparently been slept in but there's no one in
the room. Sarah walks down the hall to the bathroom and knocks on the door.
                  
				SARAH
		Laura?
                  
No answer. She tries the door, opens it. No one inside. Sarah goes back into the
hall, starting to worry.
                  
				SARAH
			(louder)
		Laura! Honey, are you downstairs?
                  
She goes into Laura's room. Notices for the first time that the window is open and
the lace curtains are blowing in the breeze.
                  
Sarah picks up the white princess phone beside Laura's bed, dials and waits for
someone to answer.
                  
				SARAH
			(into the phone)
		Bette, it's Sarah, listen, I just came up to wake
		Laura and she's not here, is she with Bobby?
							INTERCUT:
INT. BRIGGS HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
                  
BETTY BRlGGS, a healthy, solid woman, early forties, is on the phone. Her
husband, MAJOR GARLAND BRIGGS, a rock-hard Air Force career man, sits at the
table in background, ramrod-stiff, drinking black coffee.

				BETTY
			(into the phone)
		She might be, Sarah, but Bobby leaves here
		about five to go running and then goes on to
		football practice.

				SARAH
		Can you reach him? Can you find out? I'll call
		the school -

				BETTY
		I've got the number of the fieldhouse here, let
		me get that for you - it's 474 -

				SARAH
			(writing it down)
		Thanks, Bette -
			(a new idea)
		You know, I'm wondering if she might have gone
		out with Leland, he had an early meeting -

				BETTY
		I'm sure that's it, or she's with Bobby -
    
				SARAH
		Sure, let me call up to the hotel, thanks.
    
She hangs up, then starts to dial another number.
							CUT TO:
    
EXT. TWIN PEAKS HIGH SCHOOL FIELDHOUSE - MORNING
    
MAX HARTMEN, the genial, verbose football coach, picks up the phone at the
fieldhouse window. Football players are practicing on the field in background.
    
				HARTMAN
			(into the phone)
		Yeah, hello, this is the Coach ... yeah, Mrs.
		Palmer, no, Bobby didn't show up for practice
		yet, matter of fact, come to think of it, he's been
		late every day this week, possibly even last week
		and the week before, although he might be here
		before you know it - well, I could have him call
		you Mrs. Palmer, is it urgent? ... okay, sure, fine.
    
							CUT TO:
EXT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL - MORNING
    
Re-establish.
							CUT TO:
    
INT. GREAT NORTHERN PRIVATE DINING ROOM - MORNING
    
A group of fifteen NORWEGIAN BUSINESSMEN sit around an executive dining
table, talking animatedly in Norwegian while consuming an immense, hearty
breakfast.
							CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - MORNING
    
In an inner office, BENJAMIN HORNE, a roguish, charismatic man, mid-forties
looks in at the Norwegians, then consults with his lawyer, LELAND PALMER, a
handsome, refined man of fifty, who takes a sheath of legal contracts from a
briefcase and shows them to Horne.

				HORNE
			(glancing at the contracts)
		Are they ready to sign?
    
				LELAND
		You don't want to mention to them that we don't
		as yet have access to the Packard land -
    
				HORNE
		By the time we're ready to start building we'll
		have that land, what they don't know won't hurt
		them -
			(holds up a hand to silence him)
		- I have solid information that the Packard
		Sawmill will go belly-up within a year. We will
		buy it for a song; one verse, no chorus.
			(hands back the contracts)
		Let's go get these cheese-eaters where they live.
    
As they move into the dining room, we MOVE to a LARGE MAP on the wall,
topographical of Twin Peaks and environs.
    
On the map, in a red-shaded area northeast of the Packard Sawmill on Black Lake
we see the words: "PROPOSED SITE FOR GHOSTWOOD COUNTRY CLUB AND
ESTATES"
							DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOTEL DlNING ROOM - MORNING
    
Benjamin Home stands at the head of a table, addressing the fifteen Norwegian
businessmen. Beside him, an INTERPRETOR translates each sentence into
Norwegian. Leland Palmer sits at Horne's right hand.
    
				HORNE
			(in the middle of his spiel)
		... and great opportunities for growth and
		expansion with a minimal capital outlay ... a clean
		and wholesome environment much like your own
		... with a quality of life to rival the best our
		country can offer ... of course when I first spoke
		to Sven he was naturally concerned about the air
		here ... if you'll permit me to repeat what you
		told me after your run this morning, Sven ...
			(pounds his chest enthusiastically)
		"My air sacs never felt so good!"
    
After the translation, the group all nod good-naturedly and SVEN turns red.
During which a HOTEL EMPLOYEE enters and discreetly whispers something to
Leland Palmer. Palmer nods and rises.
    
     
				LELAND
		Excuse me a moment, gentleman.
			(he stars out)
     
				HORNE
 		So you see, here in Twin Peaks, industry and
		health go hand in hand ... a harmonious and
		beneficial coexistence ...
     
Palmer exits.
							CUT TO:
INT. GREAT NORTHERN HOTEL OFFICE - MORNING
     
A waiting room with a large picture window looking out on the front lawn. Leland
Palmer enters and picks up the phone.
     
				LELAND
		Leland Palmer ...
							INTERCUT:
INT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
     
Sarah Palmer, on the phone in the kitchen, lighting another cigarette with the butt
of the one she's just finishing.
     
				SARAH
		Honey, it's Sarah, is Laura with you?
     
				LELAND
		No, why?
     
				SARAH
			(slightly hysterical)
		She didn't go with you this morning?
     
				LELAND
		No, what's wrong, what's this about?
     
				SARAH
		She's not here, she wasn't here this morning -
     
Looking out the window, Leland sees Sheriff Steadman drive up, park and walk
towards the hotel.
     
				LELAND
		She's probably with Bobby -
     
				SARAH
		I can't find him -

				LELAND
		Well that's it then, let's not worry -
   
				SARAH
		She would've left a note, why didn't she tell me?
		Why didn't she leave me a note?
   
				LELAND
		Sarah, calm down, darling, please ...
   
Looking out towards the lobby he sees Steadman, speaking to the DESK CLERK,
who points in to where Leland is on the phone. The Sheriff sees Leland, locks
eyes with him and starts walking towards him.
   
				LELAND (CONTINUED)
			(the first hint of alarm, to himself)
		Sheriff Steadman ...
   
				SARAH
			(panicking)
		Who? What did you say?
   
				LELAND
			(trying to cover)
		Please. Sarah. I'm going to have to call you
		back.
   
				SARAH
			(seeing it all, coming unglued)
		Oh my God ... oh my God, Laura, no, Laura!
   
				LELAND
		Sarah ...
   
The Sheriff reaches Leland, hat in hand. Leland covers the mouthpiece of the
phone.
   
				STEADMAN
		Mr. Palmer ...
   
				LELAND
		Is this about Laura?

				STEADMAN
		I'm afraid it is, sir.
   
We hear Sarah screaming for Leland over the phone.
							CUT TO:

SARAH
				SARAH
		Leland, what is it? My baby! Tell me, oh God,
		Leland!
							CUT TO:
LELAND
    
Having heard the news, he goes back to the phone.
    
				LELAND
			(trembling, trying to stay calm)
		Sarah, I'm on my way home ... please, Sarah.
    
He hangs up. Picks up and struggling to remember the number, unsteadily
punches it in.

				LELAND
		Janice, this is Leland, oh God ...
			(he's momentarily overcome, then)
		... I want you to go next door and stay with Sarah
		until I get there - please just do it.
    
He hangs up.
    
				STEADMAN
		Let me drive you, sir.
    
Palmer nods, points vaguely back towards the meeting room.
    
				LELAND
		I, uh, should tell Mr. Home and the ...
    
				STEADMAN
		I'm sure they'll understand.
    
Benjamin Horne appears in the doorway.
    
				HORNE
		Leland, we're ready to go over the contracts ...
			(sees him)
		Leland?
    
				LELAND
		My daughter's dead.
							CUT TO:
EXT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
    
JANICE HOGAN, the Palmer's next door neighbor, exits the front door of her
house and runs next door to the Palmers' house. She knocks on the door. We
hear a heart-rending wail of grief from inside.
    

				JANICE
		Sarah?!
    
She opens she door and rushes inside. Pause.  Another cry.
							CUT TO:
EXT. DOUBLE "R" DlNER - MORNING
    
Re-establish. A Volkswagen beetle pulls up and a UNIFORMED WAlTRESS gets out
and goes inside.
							CUT TO:
INT. DOUBLE "R" DINER - MORNING
    
SHELLY JOHNSON, a young, slim waitress, is putting on her coat, as the other
waitress, HEIDI, a hefty German girl, enters. The owner of the diner, NORMA
JENNlNGS, a statuesque, well-preserved forty year old former beauty queen, pours
a warm-up for BOBBY BRIGGS, handsome, muscular high school senior, wearing a
a letter jacket.
    
				SHELLY
			(popping gum)
		What kept ya, Heidi? Seconds on knockwurst
		this morning?
    
Heidi, a bubbly, easily embarrassed girl, giggles and blushes.
    
				HEIDI
		I couldn't get my car started.
    
				SHELLY
		Too busy jumpstartin' the old man.
    
				BOBBY
		Thought you Germans were always on time.
    
				NORMA
		Bobby, I thought the only time you cared about
		was makin' time.
    
Bobby and Shelly exchange a slightly guilty look. Bobby rises, puts some change
on the counter.
    
				BOBBY
		Hey, Shelly, you headin' out?
    
				SHELLY
		Headin' home.

    
				BOBBY
		I gotta go to practice, I could drop you at your
		place on the way.
    
				SHELLY
		That'd be great, thanks.
    
				BOBBY
			(as they go, holds up a quarter)
		Here's a tune for you gals. Norma, I'll see you in
		my dreams.
    
				NORMA
		Not if I see you first.
    
				BOBBY
		Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
    
He drops the quarter in a jukebox, punches a song in. Bobby and Shelly exit the
diner as an aggressively cheerful German Polka blares from the jukebox.
    
							CUT TO:
EXT. DINER - MORNING
    
Bobby opens the door of his souped-up Buick Electra '88 convertible for Shelly.
    
				BOBBY
			(under his breath)
		I think she knows about us.
    
				SHELLY
		Norma? Fat chance. She's probably hot to trot
		for you herself.
    
She gets in.
							CUT TO:
INT. BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING
    
Bobby climbs in behind the wheel and starts the car. They look around for a
moment, make sure no one is watching them, then kiss hotly.
    
				SHELLY
		I was thinkin' about you.
    
				BOBBY
		Yeah?
     
				SHELLY
		All night.
			(she caresses him intimately)
     
				BOBBY
		All right.
     
He steps on it and peels out of the parking lot.
							CUT TO:
EXT. LUCKY HIGHWAY "21" - MORNING
     
As they drive down the highway, a Sheriff's cruiser, lights and siren blaring,
approaches them, heated the other way.
							CUT TO
INT. BOBBY'S CAR - MORNING
     
Shelly and Bobby watch the cruiser as it zooms by them, then look back. She
takes a pull off a silver flask and knocks it back. Bobby looks at her.
     
				SHELLY
		Hey, it's happy hour in France.
			(offers it to Bobby)
		Come on. Breakfast of champions.
     
				BOBBY
		Right. 'Little pick-me-up before Home Room.
     
				SHELLY
		Thought I was your little pick-me-up.
     
				BOBBY
		Baby, you're more like a three-stage rocket. A
		pocket rocket.
     
				SHELLY
		What stage are we in now?
     
				BOBBY
		You sure your old man's still on the road?
     
				SHELLY
		Called me last night from Tacoma. Talked dirty
		to me for an hour. And he ain't got a phone in
		his truck.
                        	(a highly suggestive look)
		Quit worryin' and start scurryin', Mr. Touchdown.

Bobby steps on it.
							CUT TO:
 
EXT. WINDING ROAD - MORNING
    
At the base of Sparkwood Mountain. Bobby drives around a corner and starts up

							CUT TO:
EXT. PALMER HOUSE - MORNING
    
Sheriff Steadman drives his cruiser into the driveway and Leland Palmer steps out
on the passenger's car. Mrs. Palmer comes frantically out of the house and down
the steps. He stops. She moves close to him, sees the grief in his eyes, then runs
to him, screaming, hitting him, sobbing hysterically. He struggles to hold onto
her until she collapses in his arms.
