Behind the wheel is FBI field agent DALE COOPER, mid-thirties, handsome in an
unremarkable way. He activates and speaks into a microphone attached to his
lapel, connected to a small, Walkman-sized tape recorder clipped to his belt.

		Diane, 2:15 in the afternoon, November 14.
		Entering town of Twin Peaks. Five miles south of
		the Canadian border, twelve miles west of the
		state line. Never seen so many trees in my life.
		As W.C. Fields would say, I'd rather be here than
		Philadelphia. It's 54 degrees on a beautiful sunny
		afternoon. Weatherman said rain. If you could
		get paid that kind of money for being wrong 60%
		of the time it'd beat working. Mileage is 79,345,
		gauge is on reserve, I'm riding on fumes, have to
		tank up when I get into town, remind me to tell
		you how much that is. Lunch was $6.31 and I left
		her a dollar tip, at the ...

		... Lamplighter Inn, that's on Highway 2 near
		Lewis Fork. That was a tuna fish sandwich on

		Okay.

		I'll be looking for a ...

		... Sheriff Daniel Steadman, he's going to be at
		the Calhoun Memorial Hospital with that girl they
		pulled off the mountain. I'll be checking into a
		motel after we're through there. Sure the
		Sheriff'll be able to recommend a clean place.
		Reasonably priced.
     
Turns off the microphone. Turns it back on again.
     
				COOPER (CONTINUED)
		Forgot to mention. I stopped for coffee and a
		pit stop about 10:30, little diner near Bitteroot
		Lake. Excellent coffee. Forgot to get the
		receipt, can you believe it? That was seventy fire
		cents and I left a quarter on the counter. Got to
		find out what kind of trees these are. They're
		really something.
